**Car Dheko: Used Car Price Prediction**

**Objective**
The goal of this project is to enhance the customer experience and streamline the pricing process for used cars by leveraging machine learning. We aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features. This model will be integrated into an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing customers and sales representatives to easily obtain estimated prices for used cars.

**Project Scope**

**Data Processing**

**Import and Concatenate:** Import and concatenate datasets from different cities into a structured format.

**Handling Missing Values:** Identify and handle missing values   using appropriate imputation techniques.

**Standardizing Data Formats:** Ensure data is in the correct format by converting units and adjusting data types.

**Encoding Categorical Variables:** Convert categorical features into numerical values using encoding techniques.

**Normalizing Numerical Features:** Scale numerical features using normalization techniques.

**Removing Outliers:** Detect and handle outliers to avoid skewing the model.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics to understand data distribution.

**Data Visualization:** Use visualizations to identify patterns and correlations in the data.

**Feature Selection:** Identify and select important features impacting car prices.

**Model Development**

**Train-Test Split:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

**Model Selection:** Choose and train appropriate machine learning algorithms for price prediction.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

**Model Evaluation**

**Performance Metrics:** Evaluate the model using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R-squared.

**Model Comparison:** Compare different models to select the best-performing one.


**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters using Grid Search or Random Search.

**Model Evaluation**

**Performance Metrics:** Evaluate models using MAE, MSE, R-squared.

**Model Comparison:** Select the best model based on evaluation metrics.

**Optimization**

**Feature Engineering:** Enhance features using domain knowledge and EDA insights.

**Regularization:** Apply Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization.

**Deployment**

**Streamlit Application:** Develop and deploy a Streamlit-based web application for real-time price predictions.

**User Interface Design:** Ensure a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
