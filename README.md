##**Car Dheko: Used Car Price Prediction**

##**Objective**
The goal of this project is to enhance the customer experience and streamline the pricing process for used cars by leveraging machine learning. We aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features. This model will be integrated into an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing customers and sales representatives to easily obtain estimated prices for used cars.

##**Project Scope**
##**Data Processing**

**Import and Concatenate:** Import and concatenate datasets from different cities into a structured format.
**Handling Missing Values:** Identify and handle missing values   using appropriate imputation techniques.
**Standardizing Data Formats:** Ensure data is in the correct format by converting units and adjusting data types.
**Encoding Categorical Variables:** Convert categorical features into numerical values using encoding techniques.
**Normalizing Numerical Features:** Scale numerical features using normalization techniques.
**Removing Outliers:** Detect and handle outliers to avoid skewing the model.
##**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics to understand data distribution.
**Data Visualization:** Use visualizations to identify patterns and correlations in the data.
**Feature Selection:** Identify and select important features impacting car prices.
##**Model Development**

**Train-Test Split:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
**Model Selection:** Choose and train appropriate machine learning algorithms for price prediction.
**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
##**Model Evaluation**

**Performance Metrics:** Evaluate the model using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R-squared.
**Model Comparison:** Compare different models to select the best-performing one.
##**Optimization**

**Feature Engineering:** Create or modify features to enhance model performance.
**Regularization:** Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
##**Deployment**

**Streamlit Application:** Deploy the model using Streamlit to create an interactive web application.
**User Interface Design:** Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface for easy interaction.
##**Approach**
##**Data Processing**
**Import and Concatenate:** Load datasets from different cities, convert them to a structured format, add a 'City' column, and concatenate them into a single dataset.
**Handle Missing Values:** Use mean, median, mode imputation for numerical columns, and mode imputation or create a new category for categorical columns.
**Standardize Data Formats:** Clean and standardize data formats (e.g., remove units from numerical values).
**Encode Categorical Variables:** Apply one-hot or label encoding as needed.
**Normalize Numerical Features:** Scale numerical features using Min-Max Scaling or Standard Scaling.
**Remove Outliers:** Use IQR or Z-score methods to handle outliers.
##**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Descriptive Statistics:** Compute and analyze summary statistics.
**Data Visualization:** Create visualizations to detect patterns and correlations.
**Feature Selection:** Determine significant features affecting car prices.
##**Model Development**
**Train-Test Split:** Divide data into training and testing sets.
**Model Selection:** Train models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines.
**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters using Grid Search or Random Search.
##**Model Evaluation**
**Performance Metrics:** Evaluate models using MAE, MSE, R-squared.
**Model Comparison:** Select the best model based on evaluation metrics.
##**Optimization**
**Feature Engineering:** Enhance features using domain knowledge and EDA insights.
**Regularization:** Apply Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization.
##**Deployment**
**Streamlit Application:** Develop and deploy a Streamlit-based web application for real-time price predictions.
**User Interface Design:** Ensure a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
